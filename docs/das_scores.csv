5UMCZOEYKCVFAW8ZLO05,Alpha Bank,1,1,1,1,1,5,0.5,"The disclosure provides some methodological detail and mentions fossil fuel sectors in the quantitative data (4.67%), but the qualitative text itself lacks explicit fossil fuel naming, contains incomplete sector coverage discussion, offers only vague forward-looking statements about RES and ESG Strategy without timelines, remains largely neutral rather than explanatory about the reported exposure, and is sufficiently generic in structure that it could apply to most European banks' regulatory templates.",ok
549300OLBL49CW8CT155,Ibercaja,2,2,0,2,2,8,0.8,"The disclosure provides comprehensive, sector-specific fossil fuel exposure (1.26% of portfolio, €6.887 billion in high-carbon sectors) with named NACE categories and PCAF methodology, but lacks concrete transition timelines or net-zero commitments, limiting forward-looking disclosure quality.",ok
549300IQZVZ949N37S44,Crelan,0,0,0,1,0,1,0.1,"The disclosure is a boilerplate exemption statement asserting immateriality and non-applicability of Taxonomy rules to an ICSD business model, providing no fossil fuel exposure data, sector-specific analysis, transition plans, or bank-specific climate metrics that would enable ESG evaluation or peer comparison.",ok

529900HNOAA1KXQJUQ27,pbb,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,"The disclosure text provides no substantive content on fossil fuel exposure, climate transition, or environmental targets—it consists only of repeated boilerplate statements deferring disclosure pending EBA regulatory changes and declining voluntary BTAR reporting, rendering it incapable of meaningful ESG climate assessment.",ok
